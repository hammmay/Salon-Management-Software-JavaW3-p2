# Salon Management Software

#### By Laura Hamilton

## Description

This application is a demonstration of CRUD - creating, reading, updating, and destroying Java objects that exist as a one-to-many relationship within a database. The page will allow users to create new stylists on a salon management page, add service details to that stylist, view all the stylists that were created, add new clients with contact details to those stylists, view all clients assigned to a stylist, update a stylist's services, update a client's contact information, and delete any record of a stylist or client.
